- 2004
- Full-stack MVC framework for web apps
- Sweet spot is DB-backed, mid-to-large sized apps, sites or services (CRUD)
- Ideal for greenfield dev
- Therefore for startups
- Perhaps less apt for Enterprise
- Rails API project

- Convention over configuration
  - DB tables, primary key names, foreign key names, join table names, model names, controller names, helper names, file names, file paths
    ^^ make a table
  - column names (_on, _at, _type)
  - view file names (view.html.erb)
  - routes (resource_plural[/id][/nested_resource_plural])

- DSLs, declarative style
  - Look at quick building of a model, explain use of class methods

- Opinionated
  - REST (everything is a resource -- see Has Many Through)
    - Resources
  - CoffeeScript
  - Bundler

- Built for Agile, used by Agile
  - Tests created automatically (unit, functional, integration), test harness built in, framework designed for testing
  - RSpec (TDD)
  - Cucumber (Cust rep)
  - Version control with Git built in (standard .gitignore provided, e.g.)
  - Scaffolding/code generation
  - Simple, powerful migrations
  - Interoperates with many other web app dev tools/libs, e.g. Spine

- Weaknesses
  - DDD (ActiveRecord models coupled to DB tables violating SRP; no real domain layer/persistence layer)
  - DCI/Concerns ... hmm?

- Ruby and the Cloud
  - Chef
  - Vagrant
  - Fog
  - Heroku/Engine Yard 

- In the wild:
  - Basecamp
  - Twitter (moved queue and some other svcs to Scala)
  - Shopify
  - GitHub
  - Groupon
  - LivingSocial
  - Hulu
  - Yellow Pages
  - Blinksale
  - Blurb
  - Soundcloud
  - FreeAgent
  - EmergeAdapt
